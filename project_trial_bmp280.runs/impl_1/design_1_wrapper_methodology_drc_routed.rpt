There is a large setup violation of -11.277 ns between design_1_i/i2c_bmp_master_0/inst/read_buffer_reg[14]/C (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0) and design_1_i/i2c_bmp_master_0/inst/temp_comp_reg[18]/D (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
